### Book-Rating-Prediction-Model
This is a Machine learning project for the DSTI Python Labs 

## Project Requirements

In this jupyter notebook we have performed tha EDA( Exploratory Data Analysis) and using the Machine Learning algorithms we have predicted the Average ratings of the book. We have used the goodreadsbooks datasets.
Tools and technologies we have used.

1. Python : general-purpose programming language.

2. Pandas : pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

3. Numpy : NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

4. Matplotlib : Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose.

5. Seaborn : Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

6. scikit learn : scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.[3] It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.Â¶
