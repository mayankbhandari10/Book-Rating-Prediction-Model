### Book-Rating-Prediction-Model
This is a Machine learning project for the DSTI Python Labs. In this Jupyter Notebook, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predicted the average ratings of books using Machine Learning algorithms. We used the Goodreads Books dataset and the following tools and technologies:

## Project Requirements

1) Python: A general-purpose programming language.
3) Pandas: A software library written in Python for data manipulation and analysis.
4) NumPy: A Python library that adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
5) Matplotlib: A Python plotting library and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose.
6) Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
7) Scikit-learn: A free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means, and DBSCAN. It is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
